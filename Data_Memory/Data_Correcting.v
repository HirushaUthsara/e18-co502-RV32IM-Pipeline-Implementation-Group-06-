/*
Sure! Let's go through the explanation of the provided Verilog code:

The module is named DATA_CORRECTING and has five input/output ports:

FUNCTION3 is a 3-bit input used to select the operation mode.
IN_DATAMEM is a 32-bit input representing the data from memory.
OUT is a 32-bit output representing the selected data based on FUNCTION3.
OUT_DATAMEM is a 32-bit output representing the selected data to be stored in memory based on FUNCTION3.
DATA2 is a 32-bit input representing additional data.
The wire declarations are as follows:

LB is a 32-bit wire used for storing the result of concatenating the most significant bit of IN_DATAMEM[7] with the least significant byte of OUT_DATAMEM.
LBU is a 32-bit wire used for storing the result of concatenating zeros with the least significant byte of IN_DATAMEM.
LH is a 32-bit wire used for storing the result of concatenating the most significant bit of IN_DATAMEM[15] with the least significant half word of IN_DATAMEM.
LHU is a 32-bit wire used for storing the result of concatenating zeros with the least significant half word of IN_DATAMEM.
SB is a 32-bit wire used for storing the result of concatenating zeros with the least significant byte of DATA2.
SH is a 32-bit wire used for storing the result of concatenating zeros with the least significant half word of DATA2.
The assign statements define the values of LB, LBU, LH, LHU, SB, and SH based on the input values.

The first always @(*) block is a combinational logic block that selects the appropriate value for OUT based on the value of FUNCTION3. It uses a case statement to determine the selected value:

When FUNCTION3 is 3'b000 (byte mode), OUT is assigned the value of LB.
When FUNCTION3 is 3'b001 (half word mode), OUT is assigned the value of LH.
When FUNCTION3 is 3'b010 (word mode), OUT is assigned the value of IN_DATAMEM.
When FUNCTION3 is 3'b100 (unsigned byte mode), OUT is assigned the value of LBU.
When FUNCTION3 is 3'b101 (unsigned half word mode), OUT is assigned the value of LHU.
The second always @(*) block is another combinational logic block that selects the appropriate value for OUT_DATAMEM based on the value of FUNCTION3:

When FUNCTION3 is 3'b000 (byte mode), OUT_DATAMEM is assigned the value of SB.
When FUNCTION3 is 3'b001 (half word mode), OUT_DATAMEM is assigned the value of SH.
When FUNCTION3 is 3'b010 (word mode), OUT_DATAMEM is assigned the value of DATA2.
Overall, this module performs data selection and correction based on the FUNCTION3 input. The selected data is stored in OUT and `OUT
